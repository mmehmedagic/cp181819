A Warm Shower

I woke up and yawmed my way out of bed.
I brushed my teeth.
I looked out the window.
I saw that a meteorite shower started.
I ran for my life out of my house in my sleep attire.
I went into a bunker.
I ate a breakfast of converse soup.
I saw my family and friends miserable in the bunker.
I fell asleep on the cold, hard floor.

I woke up again but not in my bed.
It turned out to be a dream.
I had fallen asleep in the shower.
Oh, the irony!
A nice, warm shower...
I got ready for school after the incident.
I went to school with the following schedule:
  Period 1: Precalculus
  Period 2: Health
  Period 3: Human Geography
  Period 4: English II
  Period 5: Spanish III
  Period 6: Lunch
  Period 7: Physics 1
  Period 8: Programming 1
After school, I came home and decided to take a nap.
And so, I dozed off... ZZZZZ

The dream from before continued in a heartbeat.
It was horrifying in the bunker.
NASA came and offered to launch us to Mars beacsue of the apocolypse.
As the rocket was in the air, meteor hit us.

I woke up once again with a fright.
And the hot water was running from my brother showering.
It was 8:01 AM the next day...
